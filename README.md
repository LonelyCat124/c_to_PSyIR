# Initial README

A small prototype to enable C <=> PSyIR potentially.
Right now I imagine most stuff creates codeblocks.

It can handle a very basic (no arguments) C function and re-output it at the moment.
Development will be very slow and experimental - help is appreciated.

Use the PSyclone model for development - check the PSyclone repository for more details.
